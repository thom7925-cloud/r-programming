## Cleaning Data

```{r}
messyTurnover <- read.csv("~/Downloads/turnover-data-set (1).csv")

library(tidyverse)
cleanDat<- messyTurnover %>% filter(event==1) %>% filter(profession!= "etc") 
```


```{r}
turnoverDat <- read.csv("~/Downloads/turnover-data-set - turnover-data-set.csv")
##Cleaned by removing participants who were still employed, removed "etc." from profession, translated a couple words
```

## Does the average length of tenure differ across professions?

```{r}
r1<- aov(experience..months.~ profession, data= turnoverDat)
summary(r1) ##Findings are significant, suggesting that average length differs across professions
TukeyHSD(r1) ##Posthoc tests revealed accounting had significantly higher mean scores compared to other professions. This suggests that there is less turnover in the accounting profession.
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)
ggplot(turnoverDat, aes(x=profession, y=experience..months., fill=profession))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option = "plasma")+ theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "Average Length of Tenure Across Professions", x = "Profession", y = "Average Length of Tenure")
##Graph shows large difference between accounting boxplot and other profession plots.
```

## Does the average length of tenure differ across various modes of transportation?

```{r}
r2 <- aov(experience..months.~ transportation, data = turnoverDat)
summary(r2) ##Findings are not significant, suggesting that average length does not differ across various modes of transportation.
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(turnoverDat, aes(x=transportation, y=experience..months., fill = transportation)) +
geom_boxplot()+
scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option = "plasma")+
  labs(title = "Average Length of Tenure Across Different Modes of Transportation", x = "Mode of Transportation", y = "Average Length of Tenure")+
theme_bw()
##Graph shows little difference between groups
```


## Does the average length of tenure differ based on gender similarity between employee and supervisor?

```{r}
turnoverDat$genderSimilarity<- ifelse(turnoverDat$gender== turnoverDat$supervisorGender, "0", "1")
#Adding column to data, 0 is same gender, 1 is different gender
```

```{r}
t.test(experience..months.~ genderSimilarity, data = turnoverDat, var.equal = TRUE)
##Findings are not significant, suggesting that average length of tenure does not differ based on gender similarity
```

```{r}
ggplot(turnoverDat, aes(x=genderSimilarity, y=experience..months., fill=genderSimilarity))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option = "plasma")+ theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "Average Length of Tenure By Gender Similarity", x= "Gender Similarity (0:Same, 1:Different)", y= "Average Length of Tenure")
##Graph shows little difference between groups
```
